# RshinyApps
This github repository stores my RShiny apps examples.

## On-Off switch button
This Rshiny script allows to use nice on/off (or TRUE/FALSE) switch buttons instead of the default shiny 'checkboxInput' function.
This only uses CSS code and does not make use of javascript.
The 'switchButton' function includes two options:
* Choose between a blue/grey or a red/green button
* Choose between TRUE/FALSE, ON/OFF or NULL button text
